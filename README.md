# GPS RTK HAT 

With GPS, you can determine your location, your direction, and your route to any location on Earth in less than 30 seconds. Therefore, the better the precision, the higher! We had to include it on this board since GPS Real Time Kinematics (RTK) has perfected fine-tuning the accuracy of their GPS modules to just millimetres!

The GPS-RTK HAT from SB Components set a higher standard for high-precision GPS. It is equipped with the most recent ZED-F9P module from u-blox, which allows for 10mm of 3-dimensional accuracy. These boards can produce your X, Y, and Z location that is around the width of your fingernail. You read that right. High precision GPS necessitates both a stream of correction data from an RTCM source and a good view of the sky (sorry, no indoor site). If you have two ZED-F9P breakout boards or access to an online correction source, your ZED-F9P can output latitude, longitude, and altitude with centimeter-grade accuracy.
